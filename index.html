                        <p class="block__text">
                            It’s estimated that skills attrition and labor shortages will cost manufacturing over $1
                            trillion during the next 10 years. Manufacturers need to become even better at onboarding
                            new
                            workers and upskilling the existing workforce. Paper training and work instruction just
                            won’t do
                            it. ROO.AI delivers on the spot guidance and training using a breakthrough, intuitive visual
                            interface on mobile devices. Arm your workers to ramp up more quickly, be more productive
                            and
                            adhere more consistently to SOPs. And get full visibility to the data and activities of your
                            frontline to drive continuous improvement.

                        <p class="block__text">
                            Maintenance costs have increased more than 35% over the last 5 years. Technological
                            sophistication of vehicles has contributed to that, but it’s not the only reason. Another is
                            far less high tech - paper. Combined with the shortage of skilled drivers and the growing
                            complexity of regulations and administration, paper is keeping transportation from shifting
                            into high gear. ROO.AI and Driveroo Fleet Management boosts driver engagement and
                            accountability, delivers immediate visibility to issues, enables more effective preventative
                            maintenance and more cost effective and responsive maintenance organizations.

                            The challenges of balancing quality with increasing demand are complicated enough for food
                            and beverage manufacturers, but throw in increasing regulation and a shortage of skilled
                            workers, and those challenges might seem overwhelming. Especially, if you’re using paper for
                            work instruction, maintenance and safety. With Roo.AI you can onboard more quickly and
                            upskill the workforce. Cut changeover time, reduce machinery downtime and idle time, ensure
                            process standards to deliver higher quality and better protect the safety of your workers.
                            And now you have a built-in, automated way to monitor and record what’s happening for
                            regulatory reporting.

                            Construction companies not only face growing shortages of skilled workers, they have to
